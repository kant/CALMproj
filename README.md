# Cell Adhesion Logical Modelling (CALM) project 
This project compose my PhD thesis during 2014 to the end of 2017.
During this time I constructed, validated and analysed a logical network model of the regulation of cell adhesion properties during Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition. 
 
In this repository, I have included: 
  * The network model implemented in GINsime;  
  * The model documentation in XHTML file format
  * The phyton scripts and R code used in the model analysis; 
  * A copy of the thesis in pdf (version under revision).   

All work was supervised by Doctor Claudine Chaouiya and conducted in instituto de ciÃªncia Gulbenkian in Oeiras, Portugal.
